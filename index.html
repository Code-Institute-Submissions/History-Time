                <strong>Cold War</strong>, the opened restricted rivalry that developed after World War II between the <span>United States</span> and the <span>Soviet Union</span> and their respective allies. The Cold War was waged on political, economic, and propaganda fronts and had only limited recourse to weapons.(<a target="_blank" href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Cold-War">https://www.britannica.com/event/Cold-War</a>)

            <h2 class="uppercase text-center"> Origins </h2>

            <p>
                Following the <span>surrender of Nazi Germany in May 1945</span> near the close of World War II, the difficult wartime alliance between the United States and Great Britain on the one hand and the Soviet Union on the other began to unravel. By <span>1948 the Soviets had began left-wing governments</span> in the countries of eastern Europe that had been liberated by the Red Army. The Americans and the British feared the Soviet domination of eastern Europe and the threat of Soviet-influenced communist parties coming to power in the democracies of western Europe.Å›
            </p>

            <p>
            <span>The Soviets</span>, on the other hand, were determined to <span>maintain control </span>of eastern Europe in order to safeguard against any possible renewed threat from Germany, and they were intent on spreading communism worldwide, largely for ideological reasons. The Cold War had solidified by <span>1947â€“48</span>, when U.S. aid provided under the Marshall Plan to western Europe had brought those countries under American influence and the Soviets had installed openly communist regimes in eastern Europe.
