History Time is a website that wants to keep all people that like History together. Students can look for help as well as there is a section where you can ask any question about history and we will try our best to anwser that question. This website is targeted to students and history lovers. Once a every two / three months we do a giveaway on a history object. It can be a book or a cool artefact.
